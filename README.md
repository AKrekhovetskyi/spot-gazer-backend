# SpotGazer Backend

The DRF Backend service of the parking lot occupancy recognition system.
The repository is a part of a multi-service [SpotGather](https://github.com/AKrekhovetskyi/spot-gazer) system.

## ‚ú® Features

- JWT authentication ([default settings](https://django-rest-framework-simplejwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html) are used).
- Pagination at all endpoints (see the local [`REST_FRAMEWORK`](./django_core/settings.py) settings).

### Endpoints

- `api/schema/docs/` endpoint with Swagger documentation
- `api/video-stream-sources/` endpoint with CRUD operations to interact with video streams. Available query parameters:
  - `?active_only`: `true` or `false` - returns only video streams which are still working
  - `?mark_in_use_until`: UTC `datetime` (authentication required) - inner service parameter. Reserves video streams for a specified period of time
- `api/occupancy/` endpoint with CRUD operations to interact with occupancy of parking lots

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To successfully setup backend, your system must meet the following requirements:

- Linux OS (tested on Debian-based distributions)
- Python 3.13
- [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) and the [`poetry-dotenv-plugin`](https://github.com/pivoshenko/poetry-plugin-dotenv)

```bash
poetry self add poetry-dotenv-plugin
```

## üî© Installation

To run the backend service, execute the following commands in the Linux terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndriyKy/spot-gazer.git
cd spot-gazer-backend
```

Create an `.env` file from [`.env.sample`](./.env.sample) and set the necessary variables

```bash
mv .env.sample .env
```

Run [`build`](./build.sh) (for Linux based on Debian):

```bash
./build.sh
```

Optionally, you can create a superuser and load test data:

```bash
poetry run python3 manage.py createsuperuser
poetry run python3 manage.py loaddata test_data.json
```

Then run SpotGazer:

```bash
poetry run python3 -m manage.py runserver
```

## üíæ Storage

For **development and testing**, the environment uses a default **SQLite database**.
In **production**, the application connects to a **MySQL cluster** deployed on **AWS RDS**.
